"Batman" Begins is a 2005 superhero film based on the fictional DC Comics character<br>
Batman, co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Christian Bale,<br>
Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, <br>
Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, with Ken Watanabe and Morgan Freeman.
The film reboots the Batman film series, telling the origin story of the title
character (Bale), from his alter ego Bruce Wayne's initial fear of bats, the death
of his parents, his journey to become Batman, and his fight to stop Ra's al Ghul
(Neeson) and the terrifying Scarecrow (Murphy) from vaporizing the tainted water
 supply of Gotham City with a fear-inducing drug causing mass hysteria and violence, destroying the city in the process. It draws inspiration from classic comic book storylines such as The Man Who Falls, Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Long Halloween.
